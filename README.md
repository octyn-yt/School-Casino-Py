I know I did it in a bad way, but I wanted to make it simple for others to understand and learn from, yes its overly long but its the simplist way to show how things are done. Also if I did it another way, my teacher probably wouldn't believe me.

UPDATE: Added new game modes and fixed to run as a exe inetead of just via shell.
